## Camera

Please make sure camera is working for the video proctoring. 

**Infrastructure Testing**: The SEB, depending on your operating system, may not display you in the video (when clicking on the profile-icon at the bottom in the taskbar). To make sure that the camera is working, log into the test at the same time as a fellow student and check if you can see each other to make sure the video proctoring is working. 

**During the exam**: If you feel that the video proctoring is not working during an exam, but you are able to take the exam/mock exam: **Continue to take the exam / mock exam! We will get in touch you if something doesn't work. You do not need to contact us!**
