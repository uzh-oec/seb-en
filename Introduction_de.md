## Safe Exam Browser (SEB) 
Safe Exam Browser (SEB) is a secure browser for the conduction of online-exams held on Learning Management Systems (LMS). SEB enforces a so-called "kiosk-mode" witch prevents the use of unauthorized software during the exam.


### Start the SEB
Upon start of SEB all not-authorized applications are hidden and cannot be used during the exam. Further will SEB's own webbrowser take up the full screen and will display the startpage configured in the exam.

### Exit the SEB
In order to close SEB click on the Quit-Button or press Cmd-Q. Depending on the exam, SEB might only be closed by entering a password given by the exam staff. Upon closing of the SEB, applications which have been hidden by SEB will return to the desktop.
