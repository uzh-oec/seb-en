## Problems installing the SEB

Please follow the steps below if the Safe Exam Browser installation is not successful

1. Make sure that your operating system is up-to-date. If this is not the case, please perform the update and try again.

1. Make sure that your operating system is compatible with the installation of the SEB Browser (see [Operating Systems](https://uzh-oec.github.io/seb-en/Betriebssysteme_en.html){:target="_blank"} )

1. Make sure that you have downloaded the correct SEB version (if an older version has already been used, make sure that it has been overwritten and that there are not multiple versions on the end device. Also check the recycle bin!)


If the above steps do not result in a successful installation of the SEB, please contact [support@oec.uzh.ch](mailto:support@oec.uzh.ch) with the following details:
* Operating system of the end device
* Type of error message (with screenshot if possible)
* Installation step of the documentation (and link)

The more information you include with the email, the faster the problem can generally be fixed.
