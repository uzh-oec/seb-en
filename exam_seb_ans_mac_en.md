* If the exam time has not yet started, look for the exam within the section **Scheduled assignments**
* If the exam time has already started, look for the exam within the secton **Live assignments**

* The microphone is switched on (mandatory).
* The sound of the device is switched of
**Note**: Depending on your operating system, you may not be able to see yourself, so it is easiest to log in at the same time as another student and confirm with each other that the camera on the device is working.
