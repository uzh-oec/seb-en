### During an exam

The safe exam browser has a task bar at the bottom, where the following 

* Time
* **Profil-Icon**: this entails the video-proctoring. Depending on the settings made by the administrator you can click on it and are then able to see other people in the zoom room
* Refresh-Icon
* **Exit- Button**: when pressing the button, a password is requested, which only the administrator has. Since exiting the Safe Exam browser is not allowed, you must select **Cancel** in the pop-up when you press the button. Exiting the Safe Exam Browser AFTER submitting the exam is done with a button appearing in the EPIS-OLAT plattfrom.


### Finish an exam
You are **not** allowed to quit the Safe Exam Browser before the end of exam time slot. Early exit from the Safe Exam Browser is considered exam fraud. Do **NOT** select the button «End Safe Exam Browser» before the exam time has elapsed.
